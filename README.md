# **PyBer Analysis**
-----------------------------------


**OVERVIEW**
-----------------------------------
V. Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.


**RESULTS**
-----------------------------------
Looking more closely at the data we can start to summarize the data.  Below is the summary of the data by location type.

Breaking down the data into a pivot table and limiting the date range from January to April we can look at each type by week.

To take a closer look into the data we can look at how each type compare to eachother within a whole for different metrics.
